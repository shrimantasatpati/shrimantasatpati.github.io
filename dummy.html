                <p>Our team "Braincells" pitched a solution for the problem statement "Suggest an innovative approach to serve the educational needs of the weaker section of the society during this challenging situation of COVID-19" provided by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs . We developed an app having two versions-one through which online classes can be conducted during pandemic and the other one through which people can volunteer to educate and donate the weaker section of the society through offline events. We also gamified our app to make the volunteering-teaching-learning cycle interesting.</p>
